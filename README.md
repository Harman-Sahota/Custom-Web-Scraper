# Custom-Web-Scraper

This Django project is a versatile web scraping bot designed to efficiently search for a keyword across a list of websites, extract relevant information, and store the results in a CSV file. The bot reads website URLs from a CSV file, retrieves web page content, searches for a specified keyword, and records whether the keyword was found along with relative information.
